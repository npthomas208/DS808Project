## Overview   

 - Full life cycle supply chain optimization of one-time-use medicated syringes.
 
 - Highly constrained by regulatory requirements including disallowing recycling (even in sterilized form) any end-of-life (EOL) and end-of-use (EOU) materials.

## TBL

 - Triple Bottom Line (TBL) (Profit, People, Planet) seeks to measure financial social and environmental impact.
 
 - Main aspects:
 
    - Uncertain Parameters
    
    - TBL objectives
    
    - Assessment of environment impacts using Eco-inducator 99
 

## Uncertain Parameters - Fuzzy sets

  - Fuzzy set theory to represent vague quantitative information. Permits values to belong to a set with its membership being prababilistic as opposed to absolute. 
  
  - Work uses triangular membership function. The most likely, optimistic, and pessimistic create the vertices of the triangle in probability distribution function of the parameters.

## Motivation and research contributions

 - Development of the SSCM under uncertainty (previous works provides deterministic approach)


## Problem descriptions and modeling

One-time-use medicated need and syringe CLSCM (clossed loop supply change management). This includes multi-echelon, and a single period (time increment)

 - Objective functions:
 
    - Objective 1: Minimization of costs
    
    - Objective 2: Maximization of customer services
    
    - Objective 3: Minimization of environmental impacts
    
## Objective 1: (Profit) Minimization of costs

 - Minimization of fixed price to operate each facility and transportation costs.

## Objective 2: (People) Maximization of customer servies

	- The social benefit has been addressed by maximizing customer services in terms of customer demand coverage.

  - This in effect will force the optimal objective function to larger distribution regions (even if not absolutely more cost effective).
  
  - The presumes a priori that maximal distribution is a good unto itself, which is not further discussed but taken as given within the reviewed work.

## Objective 3: (Planet) Minimization of environmental imports

   - Step A: Identify and describe (quantitatively) the PSCM network
   
   - Step B: Quantify most characteristic (most readily available) impacts within the constrains of time and resources within the review.
   
   - Step C: Use heuristics and guidance provided by Eco-indicator literature to sum the total impact 'points'
   
   - The Eco-Indicator value is an aggregate measure of human health, ecosystem quality, and resource depletion.  There is confounding affects here human well-being which are not isolated and optimized as part of Objective 2.
