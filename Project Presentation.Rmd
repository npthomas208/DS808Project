## Overview   

  - Full life cycle supply chain optimization of one-time-use medicated syringes.
 
  - Highly constrained by regulatory requirements including disallowing recycling (even in sterilized form) any end-of-life (EOL) and end-of-use (EOU) materials.
  
  - 459 variables, 42 binary, 417 linear
  
  - 530 constraints, 498 linear one-sided inequalities, 32 (approximate) equalities

## TBL

  - Triple Bottom Line (TBL) (Profit, People, Planet) objective function ensemble seeks to measure financial social and environmental impact.
 
  - Main contributions of the reviewed work:

    - TBL objectives
 
    - Uncertain Parameters (fuzzy parameters with feasibility degree ($\beta$) modulation)
    
    - Assessment of environment impacts using Eco-inducator 99
 

## Uncertain Parameters - Fuzzy sets

  - Fuzzy set theory to represent vague quantitative information. Permits values to belong to a set with its membership being a proportionality as opposed to absolute. 
  
  - Work uses triangular membership function. Most likely, optimistic, and pessimistic create the vertices of the triangle in "fuzzy" parameter space.

## Motivation

  - Previous literature focused on clear deterministic models without incorporation of vague uncertainty in constraint domains, making interpretation of results dubious.  

  - Development of the SSCM under a framework to quantify and evaluate the various model solutions under uncertainty.

## Decision Variabls

$a,b,d,g,h$: index of suppliers, manufacturers, distribution centers, collection centers, disposal facilities

$Y_i$: binary variable indicating open/closed status of locations

$X_{ij}$ binary variable indicating use arc usage between locations

$Z_[ij]$: Integer variable indicating amount of product shipped between locations

## Constraint Quantity Notation

$a$, $\tilde{a}$: index and capacity of suppliers

$b$, $\tilde{b}_{s}$, $\tilde{b}_{f}$, $\tilde{b}_{e}$: index, capacity, fixed cost, and environmental impact of manufacturers 

$d$, $\tilde{d}_{s}$, $\tilde{d}_{f}$, $\tilde{d}_{e}$: index, capacity, fixed cost, and environmental impact of distribution centers

$c$, $\tilde{c}_{c}$: index and demand quantity of customers within a particular market region 

$g$, $\tilde{g}_{s}$, $\tilde{g}_{f}$, $\tilde{g}_{e}$: index, capacity, fixed cost, and environmental impact of collection centers

$h$, $\tilde{h}_{s}$, $\tilde{h}_{f}$, $\tilde{h}_{e}$: index, capacity, fixed cost, and environmental impact of disposal facilities

$\tilde{DS}_{ij}$: distance between to locations

$\tilde{TC}_{ij}$: per unit transport cost between locations

$\tilde{EI}_{ij}$: per unit environmental impact between locations

## Problem descriptions and modeling

One-time-use medicated need and syringe CLSCM (clossed loop supply change management). This includes multi-echelon, and a single period (time increment)

 - Objective functions:
 
    - Objective 1: (Profit) Minimization of costs
    
    - Objective 2: (People) Maximization of customer services
    
    - Objective 3: (Planet) Minimization of environmental impacts
    
## Objective 1: (Profit) Minimization of costs

 - Minimization of fixed price to operate each facility and transportation costs.

## Objective 2: (People) Maximization of customer servies

  - The social benefit has been addressed by maximizing customer service through customer demand coverage.

  - This in effect will drive the aggregate optimal objective to larger distribution regions (even if not strictly more cost effective).
  
  - This presumes a priori that maximal distribution is a good unto itself, which is not further discussed but taken as given within the reviewed work.

## Objective 3: (Planet) Minimization of environmental imports

   - Step A: Identify and describe (quantitatively) the PSCM network
   
   - Step B: Quantify most characteristic (most readily available) impacts within the constrains of time and resources within the review.
   
   - Step C: Use heuristics and guidance provided by Eco-indicator literature to sum the total impact 'points'
   
   - The Eco-Indicator value is an aggregate measure of human health, ecosystem quality, and resource depletion.  There is confounding affects here human well-being which are not isolated and optimized as part of Objective 2.

## Constraints

- 3.4 Demand must be met from somewhere

- 3.5 Shipped amount should be approximately equal to demand

- 3.6 Manufactured capacity should be greater than the amount shipped.

- 3.7 Amount shipped from distribution centers should be less than capacity.

- 3.8 Amount shipped to collection centers should be less than capacity.

- 3.9 Amount shipped to disposal centers should be less than capacity.

- 3.10 Amount shipped from manufacturer equals demand if arc is used

- 3.11 Amount shipped from distribution equals demand if acr is used.

- 3.12 A manufacturer can only ship if it is open.

- 3.13 A distribution center can only ship if it is open.

## Solution Methodology and Feasibility Degree   

  - Compromise solutions
  
  - Three methods are presented to combine the three objectives: (1) Zimmerman’s fuzzy technique; (2) γ-aggregation operator technique (3) Minimum bounded sum operator technique 
  
  - All attempt to assign combined objective function solutions into a single metric.
  
  - In effect shifts the mean between the upper and lower fuzzy bound estimate and therefore is a sliding scale risk tolerance control instrument
  
    - For example, under high risk averse precondition (high $\beta$), opening and operating fewer manufacturing and collection centers will always be preferred.

## Performance Analysis

  - Techniques for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS): the selected alternatives should have the shortest distance from the positive ideal solution, and farthest distance from the negative ideal solution.
  
  - In practice this allows for not only pursuing the greatest benefit but also avoiding risk as well.
  
  - It also allows for comparison of multiple solution methods based.

## Opimization Stepwise Summary

1. Define the network and prodposed multiobjective model, under uncertainty.

2. Compute simple expected intervals for the fuzzy parameter set.

3. Formulate the model and solve for best and worst case for each objective function.

4. Construct reformulated model using the feasibility degree to weight skewness between upper and lower expected bounds of the fuzzy parameters, and determine absolutely minima/maxima of all objective functions (to used in TOPSIS later)

5. Apply solution approaches to the ensemble of objectives.

6. Modulate feasibility degree to get identify prospective compromise solutions.

7. Perform TOPSIS on the ensemble of solution sets to maximize the aggregate benefit and also concurrently minimize risk of adverse impact.

## Results And Discussion

  - The company elected to use eight (8) manufacturing facilities and twelve (12) collection sites.  
  
  - "Interestingly, each methods γ-aggregation operator, Zimmermans’ fuzzy approach and Minimum sum bounded operator have been assigned with top three ranks at minimum feasibility degree β = 0.1 respectively." However, given the way that $\beta$ defined this will always be the case, as this is the most "loose"-ly constrained solution set.
  
  - The authors propose "fuzzy" parameters as a improvement on conventional stochastic techniques.
